       "[('The moon Enceladus, embedded in Saturn’s radiation belts, is the main internal source of neutral and charged particles in the Kronian magnetosphere. A plume of water ice molecules and dust released through geysers on the south polar region provides enough material to feed the E-ring and also the neutral torus of Saturn and the entire magnetosphere. In the time period 2005–2010 the Cassini spacecraft flew close by the moon 14 times, sometimes as low as 25 km above the surface and directly through the plume. For the very first time measurements of plasma and energetic particles inside the plume and its immediate vicinity could be obtained. In this work we summarize the results of energetic electron measurements in the energy range 27 keV to 21 MeV taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of the moon in combination with measurements of the magnetometer instrument MAG and the Electron Spectrometer ELS of the plasma instrument CAPS onboard the spacecraft. Features in the data can be interpreted as that the spacecraft was connected to the plume material along field lines well before entering the high density region of the plume. Sharp absorption signatures as the result of losses of energetic electrons bouncing along those field lines, through the emitted gas and dust clouds, clearly depend on flyby geometry as well as on measured pitch angle/look direction of the instrument. We found that the depletion signatures during some of the flybys show “ramp-like” features where only a partial depletion has been observed further away from the moon followed by nearly full absorption of electrons closer in. We interpret this as partially/fully connected to the flux tube connecting the moon with Cassini. During at least two of the flybys (with some evidence of one additional encounter) MIMI/LEMMS data are consistent with the presence of dust in energetic electron data when Cassini flew directly through the south polar plume. In addition we found gradients in the magnetic field components which are frequently found to be associated with changes in the MIMI/LEMMS particles intensities. This indicates that complex electron drifts in the vicinity of Enceladus could form forbidden regions for electrons which may appear as intensity drop-outs.',\n",

Fig. 6 shows that exospheric temperatures decrease from around 450 K near the pole to around 180 K near the equator. Voyager 2 UVS occultations of δ-Sco suggested an exospheric temperature of 420 ± 30 K near 29.5°N (Smith et al., 1983), while a recent reanalysis of Voyager UVS data inferred a value of 488 ± 14 K (Vervack and Moses, 2012).

Our model is presently unable to reproduce observed low and mid-latitude exospheric temperatures on Saturn, illustrating that magnetospheric energy is not being transported from the polar to the equatorial regions. This is related to Saturn’s fast rotation rate and the sub-corotation of the auroral thermosphere, which ultimately generates a meridional wind transporting energy from equator to pole in the deep atmosphere, thus cooling down the equatorial regions (Smith et al., 2007).

       " (\"As the conclusion of our paper, we now assess to which extent the properties of our implementation of the FATAL+ algorithm, which have been expressed and verified within our modeling framework and tested experimentally, meet our design goals. Furthermore, we will discuss a number of potential improvements and future research avenues. Our exposition will follow the optimization criteria listed in Section 2.1.7.•Area consumption: For a suitable implementation, the total number of gates is O(nlogn) per node. This can be seen by observing that the complexity of the threshold gates is dominating the asymptotic number of gates, since the O(n) remaining components of a node have a constant number of gates each; using sorting networks to implement threshold gates, the stated complexity bound follows [48]. Trivially, this number of gates is a factor of O(logn) from optimal. We conjecture that in fact this complexity is asymptotically optimal, unless one is willing to sacrifice other desirable properties of the algorithm (e.g. optimal resilience). Assuming that the gate complexity of the nodes adequately represents the area consumption of our algorithm, we conclude that our solution is satisfactory in that regard.•Communication complexity: Our implementation uses 7 (1-bit) wires per channel, and sequential encoding of the states of the main state machine would reduce this number to 5. All communication are broadcasts. Considering the complexity of the task, there seems to be very limited room for improvement.•Stabilization time: Our algorithm has a stabilization time of O(n) in the worst case. Recent findings [49] show that a polylogarithmic stabilization time can be achieved at a low communication complexity; however, this comes at the expense of suboptimal resilience, a weaker adversarial model, and, most importantly, constants in the complexity bounds that make the resulting algorithm inferior to our solution for any practical range of parameters. Moreover, as formalized in [13] and demonstrated in Section 7, for a wide range of scenarios our algorithm achieves constant stabilization time. Considering the severe fault model, we conclude that despite not being optimal, our algorithm performs satisfactory with respect to this quality measure.•Resilience: It is known that 3f+1 nodes are necessary to tolerate f faults [25,14] unless cryptographic tools are available. Since the complexity incurred by cryptographic tools is prohibitive in our setting, our algorithm features optimal resilience.•Delays: As mentioned, the delay of wires is outside our control. Taking dmin+ and dmax+ into account in the quick cycle machine, we make best use of the available bounds in terms of the final frequency/synchrony trade-off. The delays incurred by the computations performed at nodes are proportional to the depths of the involved circuits. Again, the implementation of the threshold gates is the dominant cost factor here. The sorting network by Ajtai et al. [48] exhibits depth O(logn). Assuming constant fan-in of gates, this is clearly asymptotically optimal if the decision when to increase the logical clock Lv next indeed depends on all n−1 input signals of v from remote nodes. We conclude that, so far as within our control, the design goal of minimizing the incurred delays is met by our algorithm.•Metastability: We discussed several effective measures to prevent metastability in Section 6. Our experiments support our theoretical finding that, after stabilization, metastability may not occur in absence of further faults. However, since metastability is an elusive problem for which it is difficult to transfer insights and observations to other modes of operation of a given system—let alone to different implementation technology—a mathematical treatment of metastability is highly desirable. Our model opens up various possible approaches to this issue. For one, it is feasible to switch to a more accurate description of signals in terms of signals' voltages as continuous functions of time. Another option choosing an intermediate level of complexity would be to add an additional signal state (e.g. ⊥) for “invalid” signals, representing e.g. creeping or oscillating signals. Assigning appropriate probabilities of metastability propagation and decay to modules, this would enable a unified probabilistic analysis of metastability generation, propagation, and decay within a modeling framework using discrete state representations. Such an approach could yield entirely unconditional guarantees on system recovery; in contrast, our current description requires an a priori guarantee that metastability is sufficiently contained during the stabilization process.•Connectivity: The algorithm presented in this work requires to connect all pairs of nodes and is therefore not scalable. Unfortunately, it is known that Ω(n2) links are required for tolerating f∈Ω(n) faults in the worst case [26,27]. We argued for the assumption of worst-case behavior of faulty nodes; however, it appears reasonable that typical systems will not exhibit a worst-case distribution of faults within the system. Indeed, many interesting scenarios justify to assume a much more benign distribution of faults. In the extreme case where faults are distributed uniformly and independently at random with a constant probability, say, 10%, of a node being faulty, node degrees of Δ∈O(clogn) would suffice to guarantee (at a given point in time) that the probability that more than Δ/9 neighbors of any node are faulty, is at most 1−1/nc. Note that this implies that the mean time until this property is violated polynomially grows with system size. Using the FATAL+ protocol in small subsystems (of less than Δ nodes), system-wide synchronization will be much easier to achieve than if one would start from scratch. In this setting, Δ∈O(logn) would replace n in all complexity bounds of the FATAL+ algorithm, resulting in particular in gate complexity O(lognloglogn) per node, computational delay O(loglogn), and stabilization time O(clogn) with probability 1−1/nc. Thus, this approach promises “local” fault-tolerance of Ω(Δ) faults in each neighborhood in combination with excellent scalability in all complexity measures, and realizing this is a major goal of our future work.•Clock size: The constraint (1) entails that either clock size is bounded or large clocks result in larger stabilization time. This restriction can be overcome if we use the clocks of bounded size generated by FATAL+ as input to another layer that runs a synchronous consensus algorithm in order to agree on exponentially larger clocks [41]. Finally, we would like to mention two more prospective extensions of our work. First, building on our modeling framework, it seems feasible to tackle an even more strict verification of the algorithm's properties than “standard” mathematical analysis. The hierarchical structure and formal specifications of modules seem amenable to formal verification methods. Such an approach should benefit from the possibilities to adjust the granularity of the model by the distinction between basic and compound modules as well as the restrictions imposed by the module specifications; more restrictive modules may be simpler to analyze, yet will guarantee the same properties as the stated variants. Second, it should be noted that it is straightforward to derive clocks of even higher frequency from the FATAL+ clocks. This is essentially done by frequency multiplication, at the expense of increasing the clock skew. We refer to Dolev et al. [13] for details.\",\n",

The thermosphere component globally solves the non-linear Navier–Stokes equations of momentum, continuity and energy on a spherical pressure level grid. The momentum equation includes terms such as pressure gradients, viscous drag, Coriolis acceleration, curvature accelerations and advection. The energy equation includes all processes of internal energy redistribution, such as advection, adiabatic heating and cooling as well as molecular and turbulent conduction.

This, in turn, may control thermospheric temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2, the region of magnetospheric electric field is considerably wider than the electron precipitation region, so the Joule heating region extends over a much wider region as well. Therefore, solar radiation does affect high latitude temperatures by means of its role as source of ionisation. This causes hemispheric differences in high latitude temperatures at solstice. In our solstice simulation (R19) we find exospheric temperatures averaged from 74°S to 90°S (the summer polar region) of 490 K, while averaging over the same latitude band in the northern (winter) hemisphere gives a value of 430 K. This difference of 60 K is a direct result of enhanced ionisation in the summer hemisphere, leading to stronger Joule heating there. We expect solar cycle variations of high latitude temperatures to lie within the same approximate range, stronger in the summer hemisphere than winter hemisphere, where solar ionisation is considerably weaker. The solar ionisation-induced hemispheric differences in atmospheric conductivity should similarly affect the magnetosphere, highlighting an interesting Sun–atmosphere–magnetosphere coupling chain that deserves more thorough examination in future studies.',\n",

Rather, the δ30Si values of size fractions between 2 and 20 μm display a good correlation (r2=0.92, Fig. 2a) with surface silicic acid concentration and, where the water source δ30Si and silicic acid concentration are known or can be reasonably estimated, converge on an apparent 30ε of ∼–1‰ (Egan et al., 2012; Fripiat et al., 2011c). This suggests that whilst inter-specific differences in fractionation factor exist in culture, in the natural environment the presence of such species does not yield a large offset in the δ30Si signature of the diatom population as a whole. Although a down core effect cannot be completely ruled out, the good agreement between the 2–10 μm and 10–20 μm size fractions in our record from Site 1090 (Fig. 6) and our previous core top study (Figs. 2 and 5) suggest that changes in the species specific fractionation factor are unlikely to be the dominant driver of Site 1090 diatom δ30Si variation.',\n",

It is interesting to note that the temperature profile depends strongly on the heating efficiency but the location of the peak and the maximum temperature depend only weakly on ηnet. This is because the vertical velocity increases with heating efficiency, leading to more efficient cooling by faster expansion that controls the peak temperature while enhanced advection and high altitude heating flatten the temperature gradient above the peak.

For instance, Fig. 7 shows the transit depths based on the SOL2 model that has a relatively high radial velocity reaching 11 km s−1 by 5Rp. The velocity structure is not detectable because the optical depth of the high velocity material is not sufficient, the LOS velocity at the limb of the planet is slower than the radial velocities in general, and because spectral line broadening within the COS instrument smooths the structure out of the line profiles. If the presence of velocity structure is confirmed in the data (Linsky et al., 2010), it probably implies that there is detached, optically thick plasma moving at large velocities around the planet. If this turns out to be the case, interaction with the stellar wind probably plays a role in giving rise to the observed absorption. Such interaction may also produce turbulence that can broaden the absorption further (e.g., Tian et al., 2005). However, we note that non-thermal broadening such as that proposed by Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) does not appear to be necessary to explain the current observations.',\n",

In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies. However, the generator efficiency with the reference strategy is lower at high wind frequencies. This reduced efficiency is due to high resistive loss caused by the high generator torque during the rapid oscillations. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01–0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A–C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss.

Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.',\n",

However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.',\n",

With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women).

Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here.

       " ('The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 ± 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of ∼0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest ⩽1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.',\n",

       " ('The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (∼33.7 Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive. Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.',\n",

Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease.

Additionally, particular cognitive strategies, for example, dysfunctional and catastrophic thoughts can increase patients' emotional distress and perceived tinnitus severity, and are thought to be closely related to personality factors [15]. Neuroticism is expressed as “individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions” [16] (p. 301). At one extreme, individuals are characterized by high levels of vulnerability to experience negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and insecurity [17]. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer [18], and an increased likelihood of arthritis, kidney/liver disease, and diabetes in the general population [19]. There is evidence that neurotic traits are stronger in tinnitus patients [20], particularly in those with higher levels of tinnitus annoyance, and recent evidence that neuroticism may predict the development of severe tinnitus in patients already experiencing some tinnitus [21]. In a cross-sectional sample of 530 participants (50% with chronic tinnitus), Bartels and colleagues [22] studied the role of type D personality (the tendency towards negative affectivity and social inhibition) on health-related quality of life and self-reported tinnitus-related distress. Tinnitus patients with type D personality reported greater tinnitus-related distress and poorer health-related quality of life compared to those with other personality types.

The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level.

Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU.

       " ('Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.',\n",

As coherent clusters are dependent on both backward and forward slices, such clusters will be more sensitive to changes in dependences within the program.

As the system evolved and went through various modifications and enhancements, the number of clusters and the profile of the clusters remained consistent other than its scaled growth with the increase in program size.

It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase. CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or “seeds” (as indicated from XRD data). As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase. As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase. This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.',\n",

We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 °C and the other at 38 °C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).',\n",
